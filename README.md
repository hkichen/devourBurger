An app to make you crave an actual burger; This app allows you to read a from a table of burgers in a MySQL database and display the data using a handlebars template.

# Instructions

Click on the link to access the app (deployed on Heroku). Dowload or clone the repository off of GitHub if you would like to contribute or change the app.

Heroku: https://afternoon-oasis-10586.herokuapp.com/

GitHub Repo: https://github.com/hkichen/devourBurger

# Troubleshooting
1. I am unable to add a new burger or update my burgers already listed. Attempting to add a burger results in an error message:"Uncaught ReferenceError: newDevoured is not defined" in the burgers.js file

2. A 404 error is the response when clicking on the buttons to eat or create the burger.

# Thoughts
This is a rough work in progress. The skeleton of the app is laid out, but there's still a lot more to do before I can even make it look pretty.
